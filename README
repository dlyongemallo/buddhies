This is a work in progress for a game for Sierra's AGI (Adventure Game Interpreter). The storyline is original, and the characters are from a cartoon I used to draw for the University of Toronto's Buddhist Student Association's newsletter, "Wisdom", in the late 1990s. The project was abandoned when I graduated from my undergraduate studies. I'm just putting it here for posterity.
