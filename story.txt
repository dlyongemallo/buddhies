Long, long ago there lived an old Buddhist priest, who stayed at an old and rusty
small temple in a mountain one night during his travel.
As nobody had lived there for a long time, it was much covered with dust and webs
of spiders. 
He was woken up by a dim light in the night and heard a strange voice: 
"Mr. Priest. Do you know who we are?"
"Wow. Gho, Ghosts!" cried he, feeling something cold on his back. 
"Mr. Priest. We'll give you three riddles. If you don't answer them, we'll eat
you. Now we'll start." 
" I have one leg and one eye. Who am I?" asked a ghost. 
" I have a square face and two teeth and three eyes. Who am I?" asked another ghost.
" I have a fire in my round paper body. Who am I? " asked the last ghost. 
"Oh, Please help me." cried he, trembling himself.
But he thought and thought hard to find out the answers.
"I see." He stood up and cried in a loud voice.
"First is the ghost of 'Umbrella'. Next is the ghost of 'GETA'(Japanese wooden clogs). Last
is the ghost of 'Japanese lantern'."
As soon as he finished speaking, they disappeared in a flash.(99.11.15)
